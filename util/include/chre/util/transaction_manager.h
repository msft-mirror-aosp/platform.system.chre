/**
 * TransactionManager tracks pending transactions.
 *
 * Transactions are long running operations identified by an ID.
 * The TransactionManager makes sure that the transactions will complete only
 * once after a call to completeTransaction or after the optional timeout
 * expires whichever comes first. A transaction will be retried by calling
 * the start callback after no complete call has been made before the retry
 * wait time.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * 1. Start a transaction. Get the ID back.
 * 2. TransactionManager will run start callback with the data.
 * 3. If the start callback fails or if the transaction is not completed,
 *    TransactionManager will call the start callback again after the retry
 *    wait time.
 * 4. Call completeTransaction with the ID.
 * 5. TransactionManager will call the complete callback with the data.
 *
 * If completeTransaction is not called before the timeout, the transaction
 * will be completed with a CHRE_ERROR_TIMEOUT.
 *
 * Ensure the thread processing the deferred callbacks is completed before the
 * destruction of the TransactionManager.
 *
 * @param TransactionData The data passed to the start and complete callbacks.
 * @param kMaxTransactions The maximum number of pending transactions.
